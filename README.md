# Asguard — AI-Powered Fraud Detection + Biometric Face Verification

![Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/version-1.2.0-blue.svg) ![Go](https://img.shields.io/badge/Go-1.25-00ADD8.svg) ![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-green.svg) ![Services](https://img.shields.io/badge/services-3-orange.svg) ![PostgreSQL](https://img.shields.io/badge/PostgreSQL-16-336791.svg)

Asguard is a real-time fraud detection platform combining rule-based risk scoring, AI-enhanced transaction analysis, biometric face recognition, and a fully programmable validation engine. It is built as a three-service system: a **Backend API** for AI-enhanced transaction risk scoring, an **asguard-face** microservice for facial embedding extraction and comparison, and a **General Validation Engine** for configurable, database-driven rule evaluation using CEL expressions.

## Overview

Asguard scores financial transactions using a weighted rule engine and optionally escalates higher-risk cases to an AI (LLM) analysis service. A dedicated **face microservice** enables biometric identity verification — accepting images, extracting 128-dimension facial embeddings using dlib, and comparing them against stored references. The new **General Validation Engine** provides a fully programmable, database-backed rule system using Google CEL expressions — enabling any team to define fraud logic without code changes or redeployments.

The system is designed to be lightweight, modular, containerized, and highly extensible.

**Primary Use Cases:**

- Real-time risk scoring for payments.
- Pre-authorization fraud checks.
- Triaging suspicious transactions for manual review.
- Biometric identity verification at onboarding or transaction time.
- Programmable, no-code rule evaluation for login security, API rate-limiting, KYC, and custom fraud logic.

---

## Key Features

- **Rule-Based Scoring:** Configurable, tiered scoring engine based on transaction amount, currency, device, IP, and location.
- **AI Escalation:** Automatically calls an LLM (Groq AI `llama-3.3-70b-versatile`) for transactions crossing a risk threshold (Score ≥ 40) for a second opinion.
- **Face Recognition Microservice:** A standalone Go service powered by `go-face` (dlib) that exposes REST endpoints for facial embedding extraction and similarity comparison.
- **General Validation Engine:** A CEL-powered, PostgreSQL-backed rule engine. Write any rule as an expression (e.g. `input.failed_attempts > 5`), store it via REST, and it takes effect immediately — no redeploy needed.
- **Dynamic Rule Management:** Full CRUD API for rules. Enable, disable, reprioritize, or update conditions at runtime. Every decision is written to an immutable audit log.
- **CORS Support:** The face service is configured with full Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) support via `gin-contrib/cors`, allowing frontend applications and other services to query it directly.
- **Multi-Stage Docker Builds:** The `asguard-face` Dockerfile uses a two-stage build — a `golang:1.25-bookworm` builder stage and a lean `debian:bookworm-slim` runtime — drastically reducing the final image size.
- **RESTful API:** Clean, JSON-based APIs powered by the standard `net/http` library (general engine) and Gin (backend, face service).
- **API Key Security:** Built-in auth middleware on all protected endpoints.
- **Request Tracing:** Each request to the face service is assigned a UUID-based `X-Request-ID` header for distributed tracing and log correlation.
- **Image Quality Scoring:** The face service optionally computes brightness, sharpness (Laplacian variance), and face-size ratio to flag poor-quality images.
- **Client SDKs:** Auto-generated client SDKs in Go, Python, and TypeScript from a unified OpenAPI specification.
- **Dockerized:** Full multi-service local setup via `docker-compose`.

## Architecture & Request Flow

Asguard operates as a three-service platform. Each service has its own responsibility and can be deployed and scaled independently.

### High-Level Architecture

```mermaid

  GeneralAPI --> RuleEngine["Rule Engine\n(engine.go)"]
  RuleEngine --> CEL["CEL Evaluator\n(evaluator.go)"]
  RuleEngine <--> PG[("PostgreSQL 16\nRules + Decisions")]
```

### Request Lifecycle — Backend (Transaction Risk)

1. **Auth:** The `APIKeyAuth` middleware validates the `x-api-key` header.
2. **Binding:** The route handler parses and validates the JSON payload.
3. **Rule Evaluation:** `risk_engine.go` applies weights to Amount, Currency, IP, Device, and Location — producing a score from 0–100.
4. **AI Gating:** If score ≥ 40, `ai_service.go` calls the Groq API with a structured system prompt.
5. **AI Influence:** The AI's recommendation (`APPROVE`, `REVIEW`, `BLOCK`) can upgrade but never downgrade the rule-based risk level.
6. **Response:** A JSON object is returned with the score, risk level, reasons, and the AI's full analysis.

### Request Lifecycle — Face Service (Biometric)

1. **CORS Preflight:** `gin-contrib/cors` handles browser `OPTIONS` requests and injects CORS headers.
2. **Auth:** The `authMiddleware` validates `Authorization: Bearer <key>` against the `API_KEYS` env var (health check is exempt).
3. **Request ID:** A UUID is generated per-request and returned as `X-Request-ID`.
4. **Image Processing:** The base64-encoded image is decoded to raw bytes and passed to the global `face.Recognizer` (loaded once at startup from the models path).
5. **Embedding Extraction or Comparison:** For `/v1/analyze`, a 128D embedding is returned. For `/v1/compare`, the probe embedding is compared against the supplied reference using Euclidean distance.
6. **Quality Checks:** Brightness, sharpness, and face-size ratio are computed and returned alongside warnings if requested.

## Prerequisites

To run Asguard locally, you will need:

- **[Go 1.21+](https://go.dev/dl/)**
- **[Git](https://git-scm.com/)**
- **[Docker & Docker Compose](https://www.docker.com/)** (required for the face service and the general engine's PostgreSQL database)
- **Groq API Key:** Required for AI-enhanced analysis. Get one at [console.groq.com](https://console.groq.com/).
- **dlib Models:** Required for the face service. Download and place in the `./models/` directory at the project root:
  - `shape_predictor_5_face_landmarks.dat`
  - `dlib_face_recognition_resnet_model_v1.dat`
  - `mmod_human_face_detector.dat`
- **sqlc** _(optional, only needed to regenerate DB code)_: `go install github.com/sqlc-dev/sqlc/cmd/sqlc@latest`

---

## Quickstart: Local Development

### Running with Go

#### Backend

```bash
git clone <repo-url>
cd asguard/backend
go mod download
```

Create a `.env` file in `backend/`:

```env
ASGUARD_API_KEY=super-secret-key
GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key
PORT=8081
```

```bash
go run main.go
```

#### Face Service

> ⚠️ The face service requires native dlib libraries. Docker is strongly recommended.

```bash
cd asguard/asguard-face
go mod download
MODELS_PATH=../../models API_KEYS=dev-key-123 PORT=8082 go run main.go
```

#### General Validation Engine

The general engine requires a **PostgreSQL database**. Start it first with the dedicated compose file:

```bash
# Step 1: Start the database (from the general/ folder)
cd asguard/general
docker compose up -d
```

```bash
# Step 2: Run the engine
go mod download
JWT_SECRET=super-secret-key go run ./cmd/server/
# Output: General Validation Engine starting on port 8083

# Step 3: Generate a token for testing
go run token.go
# Outputs a JWT valid for 24 hours
```

The engine connects to: `postgres://asguard:devpassword@localhost:5433/general_engine`

### Running with Docker Compose

The `docker-compose.yml` at the project root orchestrates the backend and face services:

```bash
# From the project root
docker compose up --build
```

This will:

- Build and start the **backend** service on port `8081`
- Build and start the **asguard-face** service on port `8082` using the multi-stage Dockerfile
- Mount the `./models/` directory into the face container (read-only)
- Connect both services on the `asguard-network` bridge network

To also run the **General Validation Engine** database:

```bash
# In a separate terminal, from the general/ folder
cd asguard/general
docker compose up -d   # starts Postgres on port 5433
```

_To stop gracefully: `Ctrl+C` then `docker compose down`_
