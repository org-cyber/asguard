# Asguard — AI-Powered Fraud Detection + Biometric Face Verification

![Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/version-1.1.0-blue.svg) ![Go](https://img.shields.io/badge/Go-1.25-00ADD8.svg) ![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-green.svg) ![Services](https://img.shields.io/badge/services-2-orange.svg)

Asguard is a real-time fraud detection platform combining rule-based risk scoring, AI-enhanced transaction analysis, and biometric face recognition. It is built as a multi-service system: a **Backend API** for transaction risk scoring and an **asguard-face** microservice for facial embedding extraction and comparison.

## Overview

Asguard scores financial transactions using a weighted rule engine and optionally escalates higher-risk cases to an AI (LLM) analysis service. In addition, a dedicated **face microservice** enables biometric identity verification — accepting images, extracting 128-dimension facial embeddings using dlib, and comparing them against stored references.

The system is designed to be lightweight, modular, containerized, and highly extensible. A responsive web UI for documentation and testing is provided in the `asguard-face` directory, complete with a custom logo.

**Primary Use Cases:**

- Real-time risk scoring for payments.
- Pre-authorization fraud checks.
- Triaging suspicious transactions for manual review.
- Biometric identity verification at onboarding or transaction time.

---

## Key Features

- **Rule-Based Scoring:** Configurable, tiered scoring engine based on transaction amount, currency, device, IP, and location.
- **AI Escalation:** Automatically calls an LLM (Groq AI `llama-3.3-70b-versatile`) for transactions crossing a risk threshold (Score ≥ 40) for a second opinion.
- **Face Recognition Microservice:** A standalone Go service powered by `go-face` (dlib) that exposes REST endpoints for facial embedding extraction and similarity comparison.
- **CORS Support:** The face service is configured with full Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) support via `gin-contrib/cors`, allowing frontend applications and other services to query it directly. Allows all origins with `GET`, `POST`, and `OPTIONS` methods, including `Authorization` headers.
- **Multi-Stage Docker Builds:** The `asguard-face` Dockerfile uses a two-stage build — a `golang:1.25-bookworm` builder stage for compiling, and a lean `debian:bookworm-slim` runtime stage — drastically reducing the final image size.
- **RESTful API:** Clean, JSON-based APIs powered by Gin across both services.
- **API Key Security:** Built-in auth middleware on all protected endpoints. The face service reads API keys from a comma-separated `API_KEYS` environment variable and validates `Authorization: Bearer <key>` headers.
- **Request Tracing:** Each request to the face service is assigned a UUID-based `X-Request-ID` header for distributed tracing and log correlation.
- **Image Quality Scoring:** The face service optionally computes brightness, sharpness (Laplacian variance), and face-size ratio to flag poor-quality images before processing.
- **Client SDKs:** Auto-generated client SDKs in Go, Python, and TypeScript from a unified OpenAPI specification.
- **Dockerized:** Full multi-service local setup via `docker-compose`.

## Architecture & Request Flow

Asguard now operates as a two-service platform. Each service has its own responsibility and can be deployed and scaled independently.

### High-Level Architecture

```mermaid
flowchart TD
  ClientApp[(Client Apps / Frontend)] -->|HTTP POST| BackendAPI["Backend API\n(Gin · Port 8081)"]
  ClientApp -->|HTTP POST| FaceAPI["Face Service\n(Gin · Port 8082)"]

  BackendAPI --> MW["Middleware\n(x-api-key Auth)"]
  MW --> RiskEngine["Risk Engine\n(Rule-based Scorer)"]
  RiskEngine -- "Score ≥ 40" --> GroqAI["Groq AI\n(llama-3.3-70b)"]

  FaceAPI --> CORS["CORS Middleware\n(gin-contrib/cors)"]
  CORS --> FaceAuth["Auth Middleware\n(Bearer Token)"]
  FaceAuth --> FaceRoutes["Routes\n/v1/analyze · /v1/compare · /health"]
  FaceRoutes --> DlibRecognizer["go-face Recognizer\n(dlib · 128D Embeddings)"]
```

### Request Lifecycle — Backend (Transaction Risk)

1. **Auth:** The `APIKeyAuth` middleware validates the `x-api-key` header.
2. **Binding:** The route handler parses and validates the JSON payload.
3. **Rule Evaluation:** `risk_engine.go` applies weights to Amount, Currency, IP, Device, and Location — producing a score from 0–100.
4. **AI Gating:** If score ≥ 40, `ai_service.go` calls the Groq API with a structured system prompt.
5. **AI Influence:** The AI's recommendation (`APPROVE`, `REVIEW`, `BLOCK`) can upgrade but never downgrade the rule-based risk level.
6. **Response:** A JSON object is returned with the score, risk level, reasons, and the AI's full analysis.

### Request Lifecycle — Face Service (Biometric)

1. **CORS Preflight:** `gin-contrib/cors` handles browser `OPTIONS` requests and injects CORS headers.
2. **Auth:** The `authMiddleware` validates `Authorization: Bearer <key>` against the `API_KEYS` env var (health check is exempt).
3. **Request ID:** A UUID is generated per-request and returned as `X-Request-ID`.
4. **Image Processing:** The base64-encoded image is decoded to raw bytes and passed to the global `face.Recognizer` (loaded once at startup from the models path).
5. **Embedding Extraction or Comparison:** For `/v1/analyze`, a 128D embedding is returned. For `/v1/compare`, the probe embedding is compared against the supplied reference using Euclidean distance.
6. **Quality Checks:** Brightness, sharpness, and face-size ratio are computed and returned alongside warnings if requested.

| Endpoint      | Method | Auth Required      | Description                                    |
| ------------- | ------ | ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------- |

## Prerequisites

To run Asguard locally, you will need:

- **[Go 1.25+](https://go.dev/dl/)**
- **[Git](https://git-scm.com/)**
- **[Docker & Docker Compose](https://www.docker.com/)** (recommended for the face service — requires dlib)
- **Groq API Key:** Required for AI-enhanced analysis. Get one at [console.groq.com](https://console.groq.com/).
- **dlib Models:** Required for the face service. Download and place in the `./models/` directory at the project root:
  - `shape_predictor_5_face_landmarks.dat`
  - `dlib_face_recognition_resnet_model_v1.dat`
  - `mmod_human_face_detector.dat`

---

## Quickstart: Local Development

### Running with Go

#### Backend

```bash
git clone <repo-url>
cd asguard/backend
go mod download
```

Create a `.env` file in `backend/`:

```env
ASGUARD_API_KEY=super-secret-key
GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key
PORT=8081
```

```bash
go run main.go
```

#### Face Service

> ⚠️ The face service requires native dlib libraries. Docker is strongly recommended.

```bash
cd asguard/asguard-face
go mod download
MODELS_PATH=../../models API_KEYS=dev-key-123 PORT=8082 go run main.go
```

### Running with Docker Compose

The `docker-compose.yml` at the project root orchestrates both services simultaneously:

```bash
# From the project root
docker compose up --build
```

This will:

- Build and start the **backend** service on port `8081`
- Build and start the **asguard-face** service on port `8082` using the multi-stage Dockerfile
- Mount the `./models/` directory into the face container (read-only)
- Connect both services on the `asguard-network` bridge network

_To stop gracefully: `Ctrl+C` then `docker compose down`_

## Client SDKs

Asguard provides auto-generated client SDKs for integrating the platform into your applications easily. The SDKs are generated using the OpenAPI Generator from the `combined-api.yaml` specification.

- **Go SDK:** Located in `sdks/go`
- **Python SDK:** Located in `sdks/python`
- **TypeScript (Axios) SDK:** Located in `sdks/typescript`

You can find a comprehensive example of how to use the Go SDK in the `test_go_sdk.go` file at the root of the repository.
